Memory Game Project

Memory Game is a simple browser game for testing and training your attention and memory. 
The object of the game is to turn over 8 pairs of matching cards.  
Match the cards in as few moves as you can. If the cards match - an attempt doesn't count and you save your rating. 
If you are sure you have lost, it is not necessary to play the game until the end. You may restart the game by clicking the Restart icon.
Have fun!
